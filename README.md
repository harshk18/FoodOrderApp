# React Meals

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Food ordering ***responsive website*** with a straightforward and user-friendly platform designed to help customers order food online.

The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It implements ***React hooks*** like **State, Refs, Effects, Reducers, Context and features like Portals, Fragments and Forward Refs**. It also utilizes **Firebase** as a backend to transfer data.

The homepage displays items rendered from the firebase real-time database which includes a name, a description, and a price. Customers can add items to their cart by any amount ( 1 to 5 ) by clicking the "Add" button, which then updates the cart.

The cart displays the items that have been added to the customer's cart, along with the total cost of the order. Customers can modify their order by removing/adding items to the cart itself.

When the customer is ready to check out, they can click the "Order" button, which opens a form to add the details of the customer after filling the form customers can place their order by clicking the "Confirm" button which then generates the text "Successfully sent the order!" onto the screen.
